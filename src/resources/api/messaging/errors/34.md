title: "10DLC Brand or Campaign messaging limit exceeded"
---
## Error description
You've reached the daily messaging limit set for your 10DLC brand or campaign.
- **T-Mobile** enforces limits at the **Brand** level, no matter how many Campaigns are linked.
- **AT&T** enforces limits at the **Campaign** level, based on the number of messages per minute (TPM), no matter how many phone numbers are linked.

## How to fix it
To raise your daily limit, you can:
- Apply for 10DLC Brand vetting.
- Import an existing external Brand vet.
