## Error description
This error applies to messages sent to US and Canadian numbers. Wavix received a delivery report (DLR) showing that the carrier blocked the message, usually because of non-compliant content.

## How to fix it
If you keep seeing this error, check that:
- Your message content complies with CTIA and carrier policies.
- The content matches what you registered for your 10DLC Campaign.
- The traffic aligns with the use case registered in your 10DLC Campaign.
- Any links or phone numbers in the message are registered under the same 10DLC Campaign tied to your Sender ID.

<Warning>
Non-compliant traffic may be blocked. Repeated violations can also result in your 10DLC Campaign suspension or permanent Wavix account termination.
