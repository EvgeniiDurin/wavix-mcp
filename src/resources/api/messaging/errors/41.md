title: "Message too long"
---
## Error description
You're trying to send a message that exceeds the maximum allowed length.

Wavix supports:
- Up to **670 characters** for Unicode (UCS-2) messages
- Up to **1,630 characters** for GSM-7 (non-Unicode) messages
## How to fix it
Check your message length and encoding.

If you're not sure about the encoding, set the `smart_encoding` parameter to `true` in your Send message request. This automatically converts Unicode characters to non-Unicode equivalents to help keep your message within the limit.
