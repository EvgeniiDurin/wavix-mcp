title: "Idempotency violation"
---
## Error description
You're trying to send more than one message with the same idempotency key.
Wavix supports idempotent requests only through the `X-Cio-Idempotency-Key` request header.

## How to fix it
Wait 12 hours before reusing the same idempotency key, or use a new key for your message.
