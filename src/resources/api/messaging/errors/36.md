title: "Daily quota exceeded (T-Mobile)"

## Error description
T-Mobile limits the number of messages you can send per day for each 10DLC Brand. The limit applies across all Campaigns linked to that Brand.

## How to fix it
To increase your daily limit, you can:
- Apply for 10DLC Brand vetting.
- Import an existing external Brand vet.

If you have questions about either option, contact support@wavix.com.
