title: "The number is inactive, lacks credits, or opted out of SMS"

## Error description
Wavix received a delivery report (DLR) indicating that the number is either inactive or has opted out of receiving messages.

In some cases, especially with US Verizon, this can also happen if the carrier blocks traffic due to non-compliance.

## How to fix it
Remove the phone number from your contact list to avoid sending messages to an inactive line.

If you keep seeing this error, check that:
- Your message content complies with CTIA and carrier policies.
- The content matches what you registered for your 10DLC Campaign.
- The traffic aligns with the use case registered in your 10DLC Campaign.
- Any links or phone numbers in the message are registered under the same 10DLC Campaign tied to your Sender ID.

<Warning>
Non-compliant traffic may be blocked. Repeated violations can also result in your 10DLC Campaign suspension or permanent Wavix account termination.
