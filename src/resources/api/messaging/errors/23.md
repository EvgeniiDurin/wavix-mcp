title: "Rejected by a far-end carrier"
---
## Error description
Wavix received a delivery report (DLR) indicating the recipient's carrier rejected the message. This usually happens due to carrier policies or restrictions on the recipient's number.

## How to fix it
Messages can be rejected for a few common reasons:
 - The recipient's phone is off or out of network coverage
 - The phone's memory is full
 - Do-not-disturb mode is turned on
 - The recipient has blocked your Sender ID

If none of these apply, contact support@wavix.com. Include the following details to help us investigate:
- Sender ID
- Destination number
- Date and time of the message
