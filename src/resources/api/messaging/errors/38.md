title: "Sending limit reached (AT&T)"

## Error description
AT&T limits the number of messages you can send per minute (TPM) for each 10DLC Campaign. The limit applies across all phone numbers linked to that Campaign.

## How to fix it
To raise your limit, you can:
- Apply for 10DLC Brand vetting.
- Import an existing external Brand vet.

If you have questions about either option, contact support@wavix.com.
