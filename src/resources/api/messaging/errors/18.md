## Error description
Wavix couldn't deliver the message because the destination number is invalid or isn't a mobile number.

## How to fix it
Make sure you're sending to a valid mobile number. You can use the [Wavix Number validator](/numbers/number-validator) — available in the API or the Customer portal — to verify the number and its type.
