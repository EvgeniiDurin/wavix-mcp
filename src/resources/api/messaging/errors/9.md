## Error description
Wavix won't send messages to subscribers who replied with a recognized stop word. This error means the person opted out.

By default, Wavix recognizes these stop words: **STOP**, **QUIT**, and **UNSUBSCRIBE**, All the words are case insensitive. If you're using a 10DLC campaign, Wavix also recognizes any custom stop words configured for your Campaign.
