Wavix uses API keys for authentication. An API key is a unique identifier that you include in your API requests to verify your identity and authorize access. To authenticate, you'll need to use your API key as the `appid` parameter in each request URL.

## Create an API key

1. [Sign in](https://app.wavix.com/) to your Wavix account.
2. In the navigation menu, select **Administration** → **API Keys**.
3. Select **Create new**.
4. Follow the prompts to generate your API key.

<Tip>
  Store your API key securely. Do not share it publicly.
