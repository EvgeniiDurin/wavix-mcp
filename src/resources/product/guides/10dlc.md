# 10DLC Registration Guide

How to register your brand and campaign for 10DLC messaging in the US

## What is 10DLC?

10DLC (10-Digit Long Code) is the standard for Application-to-Person (A2P) messaging in the United States. It allows businesses to send text messages using local 10-digit phone numbers while maintaining compliance with carrier requirements.

To send A2P messages using US local numbers, you need to:
1. Register your Brand with The Campaign Registry (TCR)
2. Register your Campaign and outbound numbers (10DLCs or Sender IDs)

## Brand Registration

A Brand represents your business entity in the TCR system. To register your brand:

1. Navigate to **SMS** > **10DLC** in your Wavix dashboard
2. Click **Register Brand**
3. Provide your business information:
   - Legal business name
   - Business type (Corporation, LLC, etc.)
   - EIN/Tax ID
   - Business address
   - Contact information
4. Submit for verification

Brand verification typically takes 1-3 business days. Once approved, you can proceed to campaign registration.

## Campaign Registration

A Campaign defines the type of messages you'll send. Each campaign is associated with specific phone numbers.

1. After brand approval, navigate to **SMS** > **10DLC** > **Campaigns**
2. Click **Create Campaign**
3. Select your registered brand
4. Choose campaign use case:
   - Marketing (promotional messages)
   - Notifications (alerts, reminders)
   - 2FA (authentication codes)
   - Customer Care (support messages)
5. Provide sample messages
6. Select phone numbers to associate
7. Submit for carrier approval

Campaign approval can take 1-7 business days depending on the use case.
