# Account FAQ

## How does account activation work?

Customer trust and security go hand in hand. At Wavix, we prioritize security by ensuring our onboarding processes are both secure and scalable. Each account is vetted before activation. If you have any issues, we're happy to work with you directly.

## How does the onboarding process work?

Our platform is designed to be intuitive for all users. Developers can go straight to our API documentation and start building, while business users might use Wavix's visual builder to start campaigns. Whatever tools work best for you, we're here to help.

## Can I test Wavix before committing?

Yes! Once you register, you'll have 30 days to experiment with the platform before being responsible for the minimum monthly commitment. If you decide not to proceed, simply disconnect your credit card or deactivate your account within 30 days.

## Can I upgrade from Flex to Flex Pro?

Yes. You'll have 30 days after your upgrade to experiment with Wavix Flex Pro before being responsible for the $250 minimum monthly commitment. During this period, you'll only pay for actual usage.

## Can I get a refund?

Wavix can return the remaining balance in your account to the original payment method. We cannot transfer balances to new or alternative payment methods.

## How do I qualify for volume discounts?

To check eligibility for volume-based discounts, email sales@wavix.com with details about your use case including expected monthly minutes, DIDs, and other services you plan to use.

## How can I secure my account?

We recommend: strong passwords, Two Factor Authentication (2FA), IP address restrictions, unique passwords per account, and securing your PBX. Contact support for security best practices.
